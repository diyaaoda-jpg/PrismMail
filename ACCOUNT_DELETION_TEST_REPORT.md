## 🗂️ DATABASE SCHEMA VERIFICATION

### CASCADE Delete Behavior ✅ VERIFIED
The following foreign key relationships with CASCADE delete were tested and confirmed working:

```sql
-- mail_index.account_id → account_connections.id (CASCADE DELETE)
-- account_folders.account_id → account_connections.id (CASCADE DELETE)  
-- priority_rules.account_id → account_connections.id (CASCADE DELETE)
```

**Test Evidence**:
- Deleted 4 accounts with associated data
- All 13 messages automatically cleaned up via CASCADE
- No orphaned records in any related table
- Perfect referential integrity maintained

## 🔧 SERVICE INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

### IMAP IDLE Service
**Status**: ✅ Partially Verified
- ✅ Database cleanup works perfectly
- ✅ Remaining active account (76cf90ef-4647-4978-9146-eb152f2e8937) continues to work
- 🔄 Service cleanup logic exists in routes.ts but not directly tested due to auth requirements
- ✅ IDLE connections continue to work for remaining accounts

### EWS Push Notification Service  
**Status**: ✅ Partially Verified
- ✅ Database cleanup works perfectly for EWS accounts
- ✅ No active EWS accounts remain (all deleted or inactive)
- 🔄 Service cleanup logic exists in routes.ts but not directly tested due to auth requirements

### Routes.ts Integration
**Status**: ✅ Logic Verified
- ✅ Deletion endpoint includes proper service cleanup calls
- ✅ IMAP accounts: calls `idleService.stopIdleConnection(id)`
- ✅ EWS accounts: calls `pushService.stopSubscription(id)`
- ✅ Database deletion via `storage.deleteAccountConnection(id)`
- 🔄 Full flow requires authentication testing
