## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### High Priority (Phase 2 Immediate)

1. **Touch Accessibility (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** Only 45.5% of buttons meet 44px touch target requirements
   - **Impact:** Poor tablet/mobile usability
   - **Solution:** Convert `size="sm"` buttons to `size="default"` (8 buttons)

2. **Performance Optimization (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** 1059.2 KB single JS file
   - **Impact:** Slow initial load on mobile
   - **Solution:** Implement code splitting and lazy loading

3. **Accessibility Compliance (Critical)**
   - **Issue:** Limited ARIA labels and semantic HTML
   - **Impact:** Poor screen reader experience
   - **Solution:** Add semantic elements and ARIA labels

### Medium Priority (Phase 2 Secondary)

4. **Auto-save Reliability**
   - **Issue:** Missing local storage fallback and cleanup
   - **Impact:** Draft loss risk
   - **Solution:** Implement localStorage fallback and unmount cleanup

5. **Email Service Integration**
   - **Issue:** Client-server query disconnection
   - **Impact:** Email functionality incomplete
   - **Solution:** Connect useQuery hooks to API endpoints

6. **Error Boundaries**
   - **Issue:** No React error boundaries implemented
   - **Impact:** App crashes on component errors
   - **Solution:** Add ErrorBoundary wrapper components

### Low Priority (Phase 3)

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - **Issue:** No testing framework installed
   - **Impact:** Manual testing only
   - **Solution:** Add Vitest/Playwright for automated testing

8. **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Issue:** No performance metrics collection
   - **Impact:** Unable to track optimization gains
   - **Solution:** Add performance.now() timing and monitoring
